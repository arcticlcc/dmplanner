###Repeating Group

---

This is an example of a section with a single repeating group.
When a group is identified as *repeatable*, it is rendered into a *tab panel*.
The tab panel includes buttons that allow for addition or removal of groups. The
groups share the same structure.

This example has a single group, so the tabs are rendered directly into the Section
title bar.
