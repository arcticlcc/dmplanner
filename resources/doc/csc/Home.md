This is an example of how to define documentation. You'd want to put instructions for completing a DMP using this tool here.
This tool also supports documentation for individual sections (see the panel on the right).

Here's the [CSC DMP JSON template](resources/examples/csc.json) that's used to render this interface.

This documentation was rendered from a [this markdown file](resources/doc/csc/Home.md).
