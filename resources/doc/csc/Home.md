#INTRODUCTION

 This Data Management Plan (DMP) format is based on the template developed by the
 [National Climate Change and Wildlife Science Center](https://nccwsc.usgs.gov/content/data-policies-and-guidance).
 This guide provides background information and instruction for completing a DMP. For help using this application,
 read the short help guide on the right.

#DATA MANAGEMENT PLAN PROCESS

The DMP includes information about data used in projects including:

  1. data inputs - existing data collections
  2. data inputs - new collections (e.g., new field data collections, new data generated, etc.)
  3. models
  4. custom software/code and web tools
  5. data products - expected datasets, code/software, and other products
  6. keywords
  7. spatial location(s)

| Statement of Intent | No DMP required.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Full Proposal       | When a Statement of Intent (SOI) results in a request for a full proposal, a DMP is required to be submitted along with the proposal. The DMP requirements during this stage are limited to information needed to understand the proposal from a data perspective. The minimal required information is identified by the *Proposal* setting. Information under the *Funded* setting may also be provided if desired but is not required.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Receipt of Award    | If the proposal is selected for funding, all of the fields in the DMP must be completed within one month of the lead researcher receiving funding, including both shaded and non-shaded fields. Fields requiring information that is not known early in the project should be marked “TBD” (To Be Determined). The fully completed DMP includes details to ensure that data products are consistently formatted and documented during development, and that data deliverables are provided with maximum utility. The DMP will help the Data Stewards assist the researcher with data management activities and make the project’s data and derived products available after project completion. The DMP should be periodically reviewed and updated. |
| Project Completion  | At project completion, the research team will work with their Data Steward to transition data (new data collections as well as final data products) and other products to the appropriate repository. All data and complete metadata descriptions must be provided to the Data Steward at project completion. For information previously agreed not be made publicly available for a period of time or that is undergoing review, data will be placed in a secure area until the period of exclusivity or review period has expired.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

#WHY PREPARE A DATA MANAGEMENT PLAN?

 - Assists with visibility, reproducibility, and validity of research projects because data are well documented, including approach and methodology.
 - Helps ensure data and data products are accessible and available for the long term.
 - Consistent with the best practices. Initiates the process of gathering metadata and documentation throughout the project life cycle.

#DATA MANAGEMENT PLAN GUIDANCE

Information should be provided for each element as appropriate. If a section is not appropriate (i.e., no new
data are being collected), that should be noted and no additional information is necessary. If information is not
known at the level of detail requested, as much information as possible should be provided. For multiple inputs
and products, create as many forms as needed so that each form represents one input or one product.

The information provided in the DMP will be reviewed as part of the proposal process. When proposals are
funded, information in the proposal will be used to create initial records for the project in a
project tracking tool and data repository. A Data Steward will contact the principal
investigator of each funded project to assist with the development of the DMP.
