###Data Inputs â€“ New Collections

---

Data that does not currently exist and will be collected or generated during the course of the project for the purposes of
creating the final data products and/or project deliverables, for example, a new field data collection.

**Note**: New data collections must be delivered as a project deliverable at project completion and do not need to be
added as a data product in the DMP.
