###Multiple Groups

---

This is an example of a section with a multiple groups of questions. When multiple groups are present,
each group is rendered as a sub-container of the Section. If a group is repeatable, it is rendered as
a tab panel. Non-repeatable groups are rendered as a *fieldset*.

**Note**: Switching the *Plan Level* will dynamically alter the layout based on the number of groups present.
