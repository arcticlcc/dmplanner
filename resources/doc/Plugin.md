###Plugins

---

This is an example of a section with a *plugin*. Plugins are essentially custom sections (or questions).
Plugins are used to provide user interfaces that are not possible with regular form fields. For example,
drag-n-drop lists or map widgets. Plugins may be configured with or without a title.
