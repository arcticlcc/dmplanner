They are found along the seaward margin of most\r\nabyssal plains and originate from the spreading of mid-ocean ridges. As such,\r\nthey usually form two strips parallel to mid-ocean ridges. They generally\r\ndecrease in height as one traverses away from the ridges as they gradually\r\nbecome covered with sediment and are replaced by abyssal plains.\r\nABYSSAL PLAINS: Flat areas of the ocean basin floor which slope less than 1\r\npart in 1000. These were formed by turbidity currents which covered the\r\npreexisting topography. Most abyssal plains are located between the base of the\ncontinental rise and the abyssal hills. The remainder are trench abyssal plains\nthat lie in the bottom of deep-sea trenches. This latter type traps all\r\nsediment from turbidity currents and prevents abyssal plains from forming\r\nfurther seaward, e.g. much of the Pacific Ocean floor.\r\n",
